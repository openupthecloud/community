#Â Getting Started

This section is to help you get your absolute start in cloud. If you're a methodical, structured type of thinker, you might want to simply skip straight to [Roles](/roles/) and start thinking about which role you want and building a learning plan. However, if you'd prefer to just get your "hands dirty" and try to understand better what the cloud is before looking into cloud roles, here is your start. 

## Starting technologies

To get hands on: 

1. **Python** - A basic scripting programming language. Good for data, cloud and web development.
2. **[AWS](/getting-started/aws.md)** - The most adopted cloud provider (The other big two: Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)

<!-- TODO: Create dev-enved projects to start with here -->

Beyond that, consider:

1. **Terraform** - A widely adopted infrastructure as code tool. 
2. **GitHub Actions** - A widely adopted continuous integration tool.

As they often come up, you may also want to take a look into:

1. [Git + GitHub](/getting-started/git-github.md)
2. [Linux](/getting-started/linux-cli.md)
3. [Docker](/getting-started/docker.md)

However, this step is simply to get your hands dirty, and help you bring the cloud to life. 

Skip to [Roles](/roles/) when you want to start building your learning plan.
