### How should you choose a project? 

A project is a way to fill gaps on your resume. Consider the projects that are going to build skills that employers will be looking for. Review your resume against your target role. Choose a project that includes a range of different skills that you're currently missing on your resume. 

### How many projects should you build? 

It depends on the gaps you're filling in your resume and background. Roughly 1-3 projects is likely enough. Fewer projects built to greater depth will be better than more projects built to shallow depth. Avoid building toy projects like "todo", or "hello world" type applications. These will not help you plug resume gaps.
