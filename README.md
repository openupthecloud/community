Hello friend, and welcome to the **Open Up The Cloud System**! üëã

This community is about building your career in cloud. Getting direction, building focus and discipline, and achieving whatever the goals you set yourself in tech, cloud and life. This community is not tech oriented. There are many other great communities for tech. This community exists more for career support and guidance. We‚Äôre here to support you in building an amazing life for yourself, your families and those around you. Learn more by reading the Open Up The Cloud [mission](https://openupthecloud.com/mission).

We look forward to sharing your **‚ÄúI got the job!‚Äù** post!

See [community documentation](https://openupthecloud.github.io/community/).

### FAQs

**Why is there an application process for the community?** It's a light one. The "application" consists of a couple of questions to ensure that you are serious about getting into and growing your career in cloud. The questions shouldn't take too long... provided you've already given it some thought.
