Hey friend, and welcome to **Open Up The Cloud**! üëã

This community is about building your career in cloud. Getting direction, building focus and discipline, and achieving whatever the goals you set yourself in tech, cloud and life. This community is not tech oriented. There are many other great communities for tech. This community exists more for career support and guidance. We‚Äôre here to support you in building an amazing life for yourself, your families and those around you. Learn more by reading the Open Up The Cloud [mission](https://openupthecloud.com/mission).

We look forward to sharing your **‚ÄúI got the job!‚Äù** post!
