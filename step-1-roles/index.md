## Considerations when choosing a cloud role

Picking a role is mostly about picking a direction. Titles in the industry widely vary company to company. To expect consistency between companies is a fools errand. However, to have success you still need to choose a role and skill set to target. When it comes to applying, be flexible in role titles of companies that you apply to, good advise for applying is "*pay attention more to the job description content than the title*".
