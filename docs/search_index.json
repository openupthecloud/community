your start and grow your career in cloud. \nThe system doesn't comprise of much original content itself, but instead aims to give a structured overview for how to get into cloud, and links to any good existing content and communities. \nThe system is broken down into several steps. You can start at any step, but if you feel \"lost\" return to the start and work back through each step to regain your confidence. \n\nGetting started\nChoosing roles\nChoosing certifications\nChoosing projects\nBuilding your network\nInterviewing, resumes & portfolios\nGiving back\n\nCommunity\nThe system has a companion Slack community to help you on your journey. This community is about building your career in cloud. Getting direction, building focus and discipline, and achieving whatever the goals you set yourself in tech, cloud and life. This community is not tech oriented. There are many other great communities for tech. This community exists more for career support and guidance. We‚Äôre here to support you in building an amazing life for yourself, your families and those around you. Learn more by reading the Open Up The Cloud mission.\nTo apply to join the Open Up The Cloud community please complete this form.\nWe look forward to sharing your ‚ÄúI got the job!‚Äù post!\nGot a cloud career question?\nThe content in this repository comes from community questions. If you have a question about cloud, or cloud careers that is not yet answered, please raise an issue. \nWant to contribute?\nTo contribute, simply fork, open a PR, or raise an issue. \nFAQs\nWhy is there an application process for the community? It's a light one. The \"application\" consists of a couple of questions to ensure that you are serious about getting into and growing your career in cloud.

Here are some basic information and exercises to start to build your comfort and proficiency with the command line. If you need a Linux environment to work in, check out the Open Cloud Dev Box. \n\n\n\nRoles that should know\nRoles that are nice to know\n\n\n\n\nDevOps, Cloud Engineers, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer\nSupport / Helpdesk, Quality Assurance Engineer\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Navigating directories + files\nThe first important thing to learn about Linux is how to navigate the file system and manipulate files. Explore and play around with the following commands. Remember that you can run man before a command to read instructions on how to use the command. For instance: man ls to understand the ls command. \n\npwd => Prints the context of where you are, it stands for \"print working directory\".\ncd => Changes the current directory. \ncp => Copies a file\ntouch => Creates a file (or updates an existing file).\nls => List the current directory.\nmkdir => Make a directory.\nmv => Move a file.\nrm => Removes a file.\n\nLinux systems use a \"shorthand\" for navigating the file system. These are called \"relative\" and \"absolute\" file paths. A relative path is (as implied) relative to where you're currently located. Absolute file paths are based on the overall structure of the system. Experiment with the commands cd ../ to navigate \"up one step in the directory structure. cd / to go to the \"root\" of the directory structure. Or cd /some/path/to/a/directory. See (relative + absolute paths for more).\nUsing only the command line:\nScenario: You are tasked with creating directories for three \"employees\" of a company. Follow the steps below to create the directories and relevant files. \n\nCreate three directories named after employees: \"Sarah\", \"Clark\", \"Anika\".\nChange directory into one of the employees directory.\nCreate a file \"employee-details.txt\"\nCopy that file into each of the other directories. \n\nBonus\n\nCreate a shell script taking 1 argument (the name), which creates a directory for each employee.\n\nExercise 2: Your first shell script\nThis exercise is to create a script that simply emits the string \"hello world\". In setting up the script you should get familiar with the syntax of a \"shebang\" in Linux, and using the chmod command to alter file permissions. \n\ntouch cloud-resume-challenge.sh => Create a file \nls => Check if the file exists\n\n\nchmod u+x cloud-resume-challenge.sh => Adds executable permissions\n#!/bin/sh => Add the \"shebang\" to the top of a shell script \necho \"hello world\" => Add scripts to the file !\n\nExercise 3: Advanced shell script\nTo understand the relevancy of shell scripting, let's do something \"real\". For this exercise we're going to take on step 4 of the cloud resume challenge, using the AWS CLI.\n\nYour HTML resume should be deployed online as an Amazon S3 static website. Services like Netlify and GitHub Pages are great and I would normally recommend them for personal static site deployments, but they make things a little too abstract for our purposes here. Use S3. -  Cloud Resume Challenge\n\nFollowing ths guide (AWS S3 Static Website Guide), complete the following steps to create a static site on S3 using the command line. By the end you should be able to delete the S3 bucket, and re-create using a single command shell script. \n\nCreated a shell script (updated permissions chmod + \"shebang\")\nCreated an S3 bucket in S3\nUpdate the S3 bucket to ensure it's a \"static site\"\nUpdate the S3 bucket policy so your site can be publically accessed\nCreate a local directory using mkdir and add an \"index.html\" file to the directory\nSync the local directory with S3 to \"upload\" your file\n\nSome useful links: \n\nAWS CLI - S3\nAWS CLI - S3API\n\nBonus\n\nUpdate the script to use a variable, rather than repeating the name\nFind a way to update policy.json to remove the hardcoded reference to the bucketname\nAdd an error.html, not just index.html\nBreak down the scripts into two (one for creating the bucket, one for syncing the files)\n\nFurther reading\n\nBlog - Shell Scripting Tutorial\nYouTube - Bash Scripting Full Course 3 Hours\nYouTube - Bash Shell Scripting Tutorial For Beginners - Bash Basics in 20 Minutes\n\n"},"getting-started/docker.html":{"url":"getting-started/docker.html","title":"Docker","keywords":"","body":"Docker\nDepending on the project you're building\nPractice:\n\nInstalling the docker CLI on your machine\nPulling a docker image from DockerHub\nWriting your own Dockerfile\n\nResources:\n\nDocker Tutorial for Beginners - A Full DevOps Course on How to Run Applications in Containers\nLearn To Cloud Guide - Phase 4: DevOps Fundamentals \n\n"},"getting-started/aws.html":{"url":"getting-started/aws.html","title":"AWS","keywords":"","body":"AWS\nTo get up and running with AWS, you'll need to create an account, and understand a few things about permissions.

Some regions don't have all the AWS services (you can look this up online). I choose us-east-1 as some services ONLY work in that region also. However, you can choose any region you like. \n\n\n\n\nWarning: You are not given AWS access credentials twice, so if you lose them, you'll need to re-create some more access credentials. Also, you should NEVER store your credentials in text files, or insecure locations. Also, you should NEVER commit your keys to GitHub or any source control. If you do, delete those access keys immediately (this process is called \"key rotation\") so they cannot be exploited.\n\nApplying permissions in IAM\nThe user created before should have no permissions. The following is a short exercise to get start to understand how IAM works, and permissions are granted to certain entities. To understand IAM, you'll need to understand a few key terms: \n\nServices (e.g. This should be quite familiar, it's one of the AWS services, e.g. S3, RDS, EC2, etc)\nActions (e.g. A \"thing\" that you're trying to do, e.g. make an S3 bucket, delete an S3 bucket) \nResources (e.g. A resource in AWS, typically one that you created, or own)\n\nWhen you run commands with the AWS CLI and you don't have permissions, the thrown error messages typically tell you the Resource + Actions that you need to configure. Here are two examples: \n\nExample (listing an S3 bucket) - Given the error: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListBuckets operation: Access Denied, ListBuckets is the Action, the resouce is any/all.  \nExample (listing an S3 bucket) - Given the error: make_bucket failed: s3://garcias-bucket-12-02-2023 An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the CreateBucket operation: Access Denied the Action is CreateBucket, the Resource is s3://garcias-bucket-12-02-2023.\n\nExercise 2: Exploring IAM permissions\nIn this exercise you're going to explore and understand policies, resources and actions, and how they affect the permissions you can access from a given entity. In this case, a user entity access AWS via the CLI. \n\nCall aws s3 ls without adding permissions for your user\n‚ùå Observe that the command returns permission denied, you don't have permissions to list S3 buckets. \n\n\nAdd an inline policy to our user to grant ListAllMyBuckets\n‚úÖ Observe success for aws s3 ls, you should see all S3 buckets. Let's try and create a bucket\n\n\nTry to create a bucket with aws s3 mb s3://sams-bucket\n‚ùå Observe permission denied, you don't have permissions to create buckets, only list. \n\n\nAdd an inline policy for CreateBucket for a specific bucket, e.g. s3://sams-bucket\n‚úÖ Observe success when creating a bucket named aws s3 mb s3://sams-bucket\n\n\nCreate another bucket called aws s3 mb s3://garcias-bucket\n‚ùå Observe permission denied, you only have permissions to act on the previously named resource, let's add it. \n\n\nUpdated the inline policy with s3://garcias-bucket\n‚úÖ Observe success creating bucket with aws s3 mb s3://garcias-bucket\n\n\n\nBonus\n\nUpdate inline policy using the wildcard character * e.g. s3://finance-* to allow the creation of buckets only the buckets prefixed with finance-\n‚úÖ Observe success for aws s3 mb s3://finance-october-2020\n‚ùå Observe failure to create bucket for aws s3 mb s3://accounting-october-2020\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\nIs this exercise covered in the AWS free tier? S3 currently charges for bucket content size + retrieval. As of the time of writing, 1 GB of data, with no traffic will cost $0.24 per year. \n\n"},"roles/":{"url":"roles/","title":"All Cloud Roles","keywords":"","body":"Choosing a role\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: These are general, broad guidelines, with an inherent bias.

Picking a role is mostly about picking a direction. Titles in the industry widely vary company to company. To expect consistency between companies is a waste of time. When it comes to applying, be flexible in role titles of companies that you apply to, good advise for applying is \"pay attention more to the job description content than the title\".\nHow do I build confidence in my learning path for my role?\nSummarise your learning plan in a simple way, such as your target role, and the skills you're thinking to learn. Share this learning plan with around ~5 other professionals. \nThe role I want is: ..............\nThe five skills I will learn are: \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5.\nDon't take all the advice you get from everyone, but consider all the information. Take a best guess at the most important skill for you to learn next and focus on that for 2 weeks to 2 months (depending on the skill). Execute. Don't look back, don't 2nd guess yourself. Execute. Then, when you're finished learning that to sufficient depth, reflect on your learning plan and repeat. \nAre there any skill roadmaps I can follow?\nWhen picking a role, you'll probably want to create your own learning plan.
