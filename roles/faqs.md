### What should I consider when choosing a role?

To have success you still need to choose a role and skill set to target. Picking a role is mostly about picking a direction. **Titles in the industry widely vary company to company.** To expect consistency between companies is a waste of time. When it comes to applying, be flexible in role titles of companies that you apply to, good advise for applying is "*pay attention more to the job description content than the title*".

### Are there any skill roadmaps I can follow? 

When picking a role, you'll probably want to create your own learning plan. Here is a list of various learning plans for inspiration.
