### What should I consider when choosing a role?

To have success you still need to choose a role and skill set to target. Picking a role is mostly about picking a direction. **Titles in the industry widely vary company to company.** To expect consistency between companies is a waste of time. When it comes to applying, be flexible in role titles of companies that you apply to, good advise for applying is "*pay attention more to the job description content than the title*".

### How do I build confidence in my learning path for my role? 

Summarise your learning plan in a simple way, such as your target role, and the skills you're thinking to learn. Share this learning plan with around ~5 other professionals. 

```
The role I want is: ..............
The five skills I will learn are: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
```

Don't take all the advice you get from everyone, but consider all the information. Take a best guess at the most important skill for you to learn next and focus on that for 2 weeks to 2 months (depending on the skill). Execute. Don't look back, don't 2nd guess yourself. Execute. Then, when you're finished learning that to sufficient depth, reflect on your learning plan and repeat.
